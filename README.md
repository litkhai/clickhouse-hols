### 4. [terraform-minio-on-aws](terraform-minio-on-aws/)
**Created:** November 2025
**Purpose:** Deploy single-node MinIO server on AWS EC2 with Terraform

Production-ready MinIO deployment on AWS infrastructure:
- **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**: Following MinIO's official recommendations
- **Automated Deployment**: One-command deployment with `deploy.sh`
- **Configurable Resources**: Instance type and EBS volume size
- **Security Groups**: Pre-configured firewall rules for MinIO API/Console/SSH
- **Optional Elastic IP**: Stable public IP for production use
- **Health Monitoring**: Automated health checks and detailed installation logs

**Use Cases:**
- Deploying S3-compatible object storage on AWS
- Creating MinIO infrastructure for ClickHouse Cloud integration
- Testing ClickHouse S3 functions with real cloud storage
- Cost-effective alternative to AWS S3 for specific workloads

**Quick Start:**
```bash
cd terraform-minio-on-aws
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret"
./deploy.sh   # Automated deployment
./destroy.sh  # Cleanup when done
```

### 5. [terraform-glue-s3-chc-integration](terraform-glue-s3-chc-integration/)
**Created:** November 2025
**Purpose:** ClickHouse Cloud integration with AWS Glue Catalog using Apache Iceberg

**⚠️ Important:** This lab demonstrates ClickHouse Cloud 25.8's current DataLakeCatalog capabilities with known limitations.

Automated infrastructure for ClickHouse Cloud + AWS Glue + Iceberg integration:
- **S3 Storage**: Encrypted bucket for Apache Iceberg data
- **AWS Glue Database**: Metadata catalog for Iceberg tables
- **PyIceberg**: Proper Iceberg v2 table creation with Glue catalog support
- **Sample Data**: Pre-configured `sales_orders` table with partitioning
- **One-Command Deployment**: Automated setup with `deploy.sh`
- **Credential Management**: Secure environment variable handling

**Current Limitations (ClickHouse Cloud 25.8):**
- ❌ `glue_database` parameter not supported in DataLakeCatalog
- ❌ IAM role-based authentication not supported (must use access keys)
- ✅ DataLakeCatalog automatically discovers all Glue databases in the region

**Future Enhancements:** Once ClickHouse Cloud adds support for `glue_database` and IAM roles, this setup will be updated accordingly.

**Use Cases:**
- Integrating ClickHouse Cloud with AWS Glue Data Catalog
- Querying Apache Iceberg tables from ClickHouse
- Database-level catalog integration (mount entire Glue database)
- Testing DataLakeCatalog engine capabilities and limitations

**Quick Start:**
```bash
cd terraform-glue-s3-chc-integration
./deploy.sh  # Prompts for AWS credentials, deploys everything
# Copy the SQL output and run in ClickHouse Cloud console
./destroy.sh # Cleanup when done
```

**Technical Architecture:**
```
ClickHouse Cloud (DataLakeCatalog)
    ↓ (AWS Credentials)
AWS Glue Catalog (clickhouse_iceberg_db)
    ↓ (Table Metadata)
S3 Bucket (Apache Iceberg Data)
    ↓ (Parquet Files)
Sample Table: sales_orders (10 records, partitioned by date)
```

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret"
./deploy.sh   # Interactive deployment
# Copy SQL examples from output and run in ClickHouse Cloud
```
